This is an updated version of CatCam I have created.  I no longer wanted to
upload files to Google Drive using the Drive API due to the fact that upload
times were too slow.  Instead I attached a 1TB external hard drive to my
raspberry pi and I am saving all video files locally.  The system has been 
running wonderfully.  The only problem I wish to improve is the PIR sensor
being too sensitive.  My next step will be to do away with the PIR sensor 
altogether and detect motion exclusively using the raspberry pi camera module.
